# üöÇ TrainStation

A FastAPI backend with React frontend for managing model train operations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

TrainStation supports both development and production deployment modes:

### Development Mode (Recommended for Development)

Development mode runs the frontend with Vite dev server for hot module replacement and fast development:

```bash
make dev
# or directly:
./Scripts/dev.sh
```

- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR at http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000/api (proxied through nginx)
- **Hot reloading** for both frontend and backend changes

### Production Mode

Production mode builds and serves optimized static files:

```bash
make prod
# or directly:
./Scripts/prod.sh
```

- **Frontend**: Built static files served by nginx at http://localhost
- **Backend API**: http://localhost/api (proxied through nginx)
- **Optimized** for performance and caching

### Legacy Deployment (Deprecated)

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED:** The `deploy/` directory configuration is being phased out. Use the root-level compose files instead:

```bash
make up      # Start all services in background (now uses root compose files)
make down    # Stop all services  
make logs    # Follow api service logs (updated from 'web' to 'api')
make ps      # Show running services
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

TrainStation uses nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests:

- **nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file server (port 80/3000)
- **api**: FastAPI backend (internal port 8000)
- **frontend**: React frontend (Vite dev server on 5173 in dev, static files in prod)
- **db**: PostgreSQL database (internal)

### Services

#### Development Mode
- **nginx**: http://localhost:3000 - Reverse proxy
  - `/api/*` ‚Üí proxied to `api:8000`
  - `/` ‚Üí proxied to `frontend:5173` (Vite dev server)

#### Production Mode  
- **nginx**: http://localhost - Reverse proxy and static server
  - `/api/*` ‚Üí proxied to `api:8000`
  - `/` ‚Üí serves built files from `frontend/dist`

### Configuration

Environment-specific configurations:
- `.env.dev` - Development environment variables
- `.env.prod` - Production environment variables
- `nginx/nginx.dev.conf` - Development nginx configuration
- `nginx/nginx.prod.conf` - Production nginx configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Switching Between Modes

```bash
# Stop current mode
make stop

# Start development mode
make dev

# Switch to production mode  
make prod
```

### Validation

Run the validation script to verify the nginx setup:

```bash
./Scripts/validate.sh
```

This script checks all configurations, builds, and provides usage instructions.

### Database Migrations

Use the migration script for database operations:

```bash
./Scripts/migrate.sh up          # Run latest migrations
./Scripts/migrate.sh make "msg"  # Create new migration
./Scripts/migrate.sh status      # Check current state
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always run migrations after pulling changes:
```bash
git pull
./Scripts/migrate.sh up
```

The current database schema includes full support for:
- **Categories** - Accessory categories and classification
- **TrackLines** - Railway track line definitions  
- **Sections** - Individual track sections within lines
- **Accessories** - Physical accessories (signals, lights, etc.)
- **Switches** - Railway switches/turnouts with positioning and routing
- **SectionConnections** - Track section connections with switch integration
- **TrainAssets** - RFID-enabled train assets (engines, cars, cabooses, etc.)
- **AssetLocationEvents** - Real-time asset location tracking with timestamps

## üè∑Ô∏è Asset Tracking Features

TrainStation now includes comprehensive RFID-based asset tracking:

### Train Assets
- **Asset Management**: Track engines, cars, cabooses, and other rolling stock
- **RFID Integration**: Each asset linked to unique RFID tag for automated detection
- **Asset Types**: Configurable asset types (Engine, Car, Caboose, Locomotive, FreightCar, PassengerCar)
- **Road Numbers**: Standard railroad asset numbering
- **Status Tracking**: Active/inactive asset status management

### Location Events
- **Real-time Tracking**: Automatic location events when RFID tags are detected
- **Reader Integration**: Support for multiple RFID readers and zones
- **Historical Data**: Complete location history for each asset
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Precise timing of all asset movements

### API Endpoints
- `GET /trainAssets` - List and search assets with filtering options
- `POST /trainAssets` - Add new assets to the system  
- `GET /trainAssets/{id}` - Get asset details with location history
- `GET /assetLocationEvents` - Query location events with filtering
- `GET /assetLocationEvents/assets/{id}/latest` - Get current asset location
- All supporting tables (categories, sections, accessories, trackLines)

See `app/alembic/README.md` for detailed migration documentation.

### Rebuilding

To rebuild all containers (useful after code changes):

```bash
./Scripts/rebuild.sh           # Preserve database
./Scripts/rebuild.sh --clean   # Reset database
```

## üéõÔ∏è Command Center

TrainStation now includes a Command Center frontend for real-time control and monitoring of model railway operations.

### Features

- **Dual App Architecture**: Switch between Admin (CRUD operations) and Command Center (control operations) modes
- **Control Dashboard**: Monitor system status, power state, active trains, and warnings
- **Virtual Track Layout**: Placeholder for future interactive track visualization
- **Shared Components**: Header, footer, and styling shared between both apps
- **Real-time Controls**: Power management and emergency stop functionality (placeholders)

### Usage

Access the Command Center by:
1. Navigate to the main application
2. Click the "Command Center" button in the header 
3. Switch back to "Admin" mode for CRUD operations

The mode is preserved in the URL with `?mode=command-center` or `?mode=admin`.

### Future Enhancements

The Command Center foundation supports future features:
- Individual track section controls
- Switch position controls  
- Train speed and direction controls
- Real-time system monitoring
- Interactive track layout visualization
- Historical event logs

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `app/` - FastAPI backend code
- `frontend/` - React frontend code with dual app architecture:
  - `src/AdminApp.tsx` - Admin CRUD interface (original functionality)
  - `src/CommandCenter*.tsx` - Command Center control interface
  - `src/AppRouter.tsx` - Main router handling app mode switching
  - `shared/` - Shared components, theme, and utilities
- `nginx/` - Nginx reverse proxy configurations
- `deploy/` - Docker Compose and deployment configuration
- `Scripts/` - Utility scripts for development
- `docker/` - Dockerfiles and container configuration

### Nginx Configuration Files

- `nginx/nginx.dev.conf` - Development mode (proxies to Vite dev server)
- `nginx/nginx.prod.conf` - Production mode (serves static files)
- `nginx/nginx.deploy.conf` - Legacy deploy configuration

## üè∑Ô∏è Automated Version Stamping

TrainStation includes an automated version stamping system that ensures every build includes up-to-date version information displayed in the frontend footer.

### How It Works

1. **Version Script**: `Scripts/stamp_version.sh` generates version metadata
   - Accepts optional tag/version argument: `./Scripts/stamp_version.sh v1.2.3`
   - Defaults to latest git tag or commit hash if no argument provided
   - Writes version info to `version.env` and copies `VITE_` variables to `frontend/.env`

2. **Prebuild Hook**: Frontend automatically runs the version script before building
   - Configured in `frontend/package.json` as a `prebuild` script
   - Runs automatically when you execute `npm run build`

3. **Frontend Display**: Footer component shows version info using Vite environment variables
   - Uses `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_VERSION` and `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_DEPLOYED`
   - Includes fallback values for development mode
   - Automatically formats deployment date for user-friendly display

### Accessing Version Info

**In the Frontend:**
```javascript
// Access version info in any component
const version = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_VERSION || 'dev'
const deployed = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_DEPLOYED || null
```

**Manual Version Stamping:**
```bash
# Stamp with current git info (auto-detects latest tag)
./Scripts/stamp_version.sh

# Stamp with specific version
./Scripts/stamp_version.sh v1.2.3
```

### Generated Files

- `version.env` - Shared environment file with all version variables
- `frontend/.env` - Updated automatically with `VITE_` prefixed variables

This system ensures every build includes accurate version metadata without manual intervention.

## üîß Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Start development mode: `make dev`
2. Make changes to frontend/backend code
3. Changes are automatically reloaded via HMR
4. Test your changes at http://localhost:3000

### Production Testing

1. Build and test production mode: `make prod`  
2. Test the optimized build at http://localhost
3. Stop and return to dev: `make stop && make dev`

All Docker Compose operations now use the root-level compose files with override support:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration  
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development overrides
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production overrides

The `deploy/` directory is deprecated and scheduled for removal.
